Sorry!,"AI-generated pictures of origami models and instructions works as yet another reminder to not believe everything you see on the internet. Just like always (and perhaps even more now), origami enthusiasts should be informed of where they can find trusted sources for origami models and instructions that don't disappoint. A few links to trusted YouTube channels and sites like Gilad's Origami database in r/origami's sidebar would be a start. Anything to spread the knowledge. 

As for AI images being posted to the subreddit (or any other site for that matter) by either oblivious or malicious users: I think it's important to inform anyone who's been tricked by AI about the difference between trusted and illegitimate sources (as opposed to blaming them for ""falling for the obvious"" or similar). I also think it's important to not immediately assume that a seemingly AI-generated post actually is AI or has been made with malicious intent. Instead, you should ask for additional pictures or other evidence. Accusing someone of ""cheating"" with AI can end badly if the accusation ends up being false, and it disappoints me when people seemingly forget that and starts accusing anyway. In my opinion, a creator should always be considered not guilty until proven otherwise. That goes for art and social media in general. ",,0.1678

I thought origami was one piece of paper so some that had multiple colors as if it was multiple pieces of paper rather than one side being one color and folds reveling the backside color I was more likely to suspect as AI. For complexity I have seen some very complicated ones that predate AI popularity so I know they can be done but some seemed too perfect and like the proportions wouldn't work for there to be just one paper involved.,I didn't realize this was a category of art people would try to use AI for. The expansion of it is worrisome and I hope origami artists can continue receiving opportunities for their work. There are some interesting creators that I've seen videos from and showing the process and I don't know that AI can show the process.,,0.6224

If there were no folded layers leading to the spot, then I knew it couldn't be real origami. I looked for symmetry and repeated patterns. If the patterns were consistent throughout, I was more likely to rate it as real. I counted fingers and checked that especially the folded layers were consistent on both sides. I was suspicious of overly glowy lighting and overly round features in hard paper. If it looked like it was being pressed out from behind, like the paper was about to burst, I was more likely to rate it AI. For photos with hands in them, I looked the creases in my own hand and tried to compare. I also checked background features; if they looked airbrushed or didn't make logical sense (like the pencil shavings in one photo) I was more likely to rate it AI.","That was hard! Especially because the resolution was so low. I would hope that if the resolution were higher, it would be easier to distinguish the real photos because of the way AI images tend to fuzz out on dense patterns.",,

Imperfections and creases are an obvious sign of real models and that helped aswell. Another minor thing which my experience helped with was how manageable and realistic the model was ( color changes espically) ,"Obviously it is a bad thing but the only way I can see it affecting the community and models is being a little misleading. Someone might be able to show off impressive ai ""models"" and get a small following but that following won't be much and wouldn't equate to much fame or money. Ai is likely no where near being able to produce crease patterns or diagrams and thus an ai creator will never reach a status of a steady cash flow I guess or whatever people  produce ai content aim for. It also definitely helps with origami being so niche. ",,

Like at least once, I see a super basic, uncreased flat body and then for some reason, there's extra detail in the limbs or accessories or whatever. To get certain levels of detail in a certain position, you have to introduce complexity into your paper right? Conceivably, you could hide a bunch of your creases behind a big flat, uncreased facade, but it's unlikely. Sometimes, it just feels physically impossible.

Other times, I just can't imagine a creator making a certain choice. Like in one of the geometric/modular origami, there's a bunch of symmetry in the whole thing, and on one of the faces. But on the other faces, the patterns are all disorganized.

Finally, some things really just hit the AI pattern-recognition squarely. And even if they weren't AI, I still categorize their visual style as social media slop. Something about the lighting, hands, framing, foliage, the general mood and composition, is hyper-real (if that's a good way to get it across). Sometimes the 3D forms are way too well-defined and I question whether or not that's possible because a model of that detail and fidelity doesn't seem to fit any style of origami I've seen even in passing. Like if I saw that picture on a papercraft forum I'd believe it, but in an origami forum, I'd say either the poster is lost or it's AI.

Sometimes the model in general looks like a style I've seen, but the details on the model don't seem possible even in that style. Like I'm really questioning the Armored Brute. The eye details? The circles on the shoulder guards? How? They look pasted on.

The Goku one I'd be distraught if I was wrong. I 100% can imagine someone posting about that proudly, and everyone in the comments praising them. I guess the sense of passion, humor, and internet culture behind the piece are just too easy to imagine for me to think it's AI? It's also styled very recognizably in the same way that I've always seen high-detail humanoid figures folded. I question about how many colors it has, especially with the wristbands, but maybe the creator just made good use of multiple sides and squares of paper?",AI and origami would be a fine combo if we didn't live in a cruel world full of liars and profiteers.,,

When in doubt, I unfortunately chose to guess that the AI was that powerful and could produce images similar to existing models and prominent folders' photography styles. Some were pretty easy to tell were AI (Ivysaur) but that Charizard is odd? It's the combined shaping choices and photography. It's like Tadashi Mori's Charizard but not sure about some parts. Models with random tears were uncanny when viewed from the lens of being possibly AI. The green dragon felt very familiar, like KNL or Neale dragon of some sort. But the blurred paper and scenario of the image kind of make me doubt the dragon. Even though I almost feel I've seen it before. Also that there were toes on only the front legs. The graph paper dog feels real based on some folds...but I just don't know about some of the representational choices, like what breed of dog it's supposed to be. That open 3d leg in the front is strange. There's the ship in the bottle like the full rigged ship that I was iffy on. It feels like something is possibly hidden in the photo. It's a little hard to see the images on the google form, and I was uncertain about some folds in the bottle. But it feels possibly real. The 3d bull has some really close folds, but it also has a 3d spot on the middle of the body that sort of makes me doubt it. It's really clean and sophisticated! If it was an older design I feel I would have remembered seeing it. Maybe I would not recognize if it's fairly recent, but it almost feels like I should have seen it?...Then there was the color change whale with the spout. The photo reminds me of Plant's photography. It feels reasonable in terms of color change and some folds...but I just don't know. There was a knight with color change that looked very clean, but the lighting and some other color change parts feel off. I'm mixed on that cutting mat in the photo. Even though it does seem to have some realistic structures, there was another one that looked AI with similar parts. Also I don't know the most about the kusudama world, so I again went based on doubt. Hopefully I'm wrong. I sincerely hope that more of the uncanny ones I flagged as AI are real!

More carefully than I would at images on social media so I’m looking at: the overall structure - would it be possible to fold this model, has an AI confused low poly with origami? The imperfections - are they things a human would do naturally when they are handling paper and folding it, are things like paper creep revealing the colour natural? The appearance of the paper as a material and whether it looks real; the overall skill level needed to create the model and whether Simeon with that level of skill is likely to make the mistakes we see in the image- AI is often “careless” on an otherwise immaculate model; ","In terms of pretty pictures for us to scroll and get a little dopamine hit,AI is already too realistic to tell. Plus folders who make real models to a high standard are using AI in the images, eg to put an animal they’ve folded into a striking setting, or to animate the model. Already I’ve seen some people doing this with models of mine they have folded. Or they are enhancing the images - if you’ve made a mistake it is easier to correct with AI than painstakingly using the clone brush in photoshop. If we prize perfection in technical folding for a photo, AI is already better than 99% of humans. Soon AI will be able to do the technical aspects of origami design effectively too, and Google already have robot hands that can fold paper. So in 2-5 years the “best origami artist” may not be a human. Creators (at least some) will have to rethink what our art is for. This may be an end of origami as we know it but also a new beginning.
